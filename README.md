# Life Expectancy

## Linear Regression

In this project, I had data from WHO(World Health Organization) and it had countries, their average life expectancy, and more data.  
I used this data to create a linear regression model that had an R2 value of .83

## Findings

I have found out that it is very important for countries to be abundant in income composition of resources and have a good school system. This means that if more people share the wealth, the overall life expectancy should go up in theory.

Feel free to use the [data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who) or the model!
